        <p>Iqbal began his career as a reader of Arabic
           after completing his Master of Arts degree in 1899,

        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>The poetry and philosophy of Rumi strongly influenced Iqbal.
         Deeply grounded in religion since childhood, Iqbal began concentrating
          intensely on the study of Islam, the culture and history of Islamic 
          civilisation and its political future, while embracing Rumi as 
          "his guide".Iqbal's works focus on reminding his readers
           of the past glories of Islamic civilisation and delivering
            the message of a pure, spiritual focus on Islam as a source 
            for socio-political liberation and greatness</p>
